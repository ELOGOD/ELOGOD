Hi, I am Elochukwu Chukwubuikem Joseph, a Final Year Computer Science Student at Nigeria's Federal University of Technology Owerri, and a Student Cloud Developer at Udacity.

I have a great interest in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, User experience development, and building usable, accessible, and equity-based software projects.

Currently, I am undergoing training with Udacity under the ALX-T Scholarship as a Cloud Developer on AWS, and Pluralsight under the Google Africa Developer Scholarship (GADS 2022) as a Cloud Engineer on GCP. I am also taking some paid courses on Coursera on Python 3 programming and Google UX Professional Specializations.

I am looking to collaborate on cloud-based software development projects and searching for internships or entry-level positions to apply my skills. In the future, I'll also like to explore and develop myself in other areas of interest and be helpful to humanity.
